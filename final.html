"You’re aware that <b> combat boots </b> are among the 
<b> coolest accessories </b> this season, but you don’t exactly know how to style them? We found a way: the coolest looks, and the most stylish girls, are the ones that manage to come up with unexpected matches, so, what would you think if we told you <b>  you can be utterly feminine, even with combat boots on" </b> ? <br> 


<br>
"The first things that come to mind when we think of combat boots? Jeans, checked shirts, tank tops, tees and oversize sweatshirts, of course. But what if you went for a pink, totally romantic dress, with pendant crystal earrings instead? Or what about a very feminine coordinated set, with mini skirt and blazer? It might seem odd, but these are actually very cool combinations we really would like to experiment with a little… The more unexpected the combination, the more spontaneous it’s going to look! You will find the sweet spot between femininity and masculinity."" <br>
